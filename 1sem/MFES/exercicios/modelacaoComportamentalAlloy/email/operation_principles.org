// Specify the following operational principles.

// Assume the existence of the following actions:
// pred send[f : User, t : User, c : Content] {...}
// pred receive[t : User, m : Message] {...}
// pred stutter {...}

// Counter-examples may depict systems that are purposely badly implemented.



pred op1 {
	// All messages in the inbox of an user are addressed to that user
     always all m: Message, u: User | m in u.inbox => m.to = u
}


pred op2 {
	// Undelivered messages cannot be in any inbox
    always all m: Undelivered, u: User | m not in u.inbox
}


pred op3 {
	// Any received message must have been sent before
    always all m: Message, u: User  |  receive[u,m] => once send[m.from, m.to, m.content]
}


pred op4 {
	// A message in an inbox can never be undelivered again
    always all u: User, m: Message | m in u.inbox => always m not in Undelivered
}


pred op5 { //???
	// If no messages are ever sent there will never be undelivered messages
    all m: Message, u1, u2 :User | always (send[u1, u2, m.content] releases no Undelivered)
}


pred op6 {
	// After a receive the respective message is no longer undelivered
    always all m: Message, u: User | receive[u,m] => after m not in Undelivered
}


pred op7 {
	// A message that becomes undelivered has never been undelivered before
    always all m : Message | (m not in Undelivered;m in Undelivered) implies historically m not in Undelivered
}


pred op8 {
	// If all possible messages have been received nothing else can happen
    always (Message = User.inbox => always stutter)
}


pred op9 { //?
	// Any received message was undelivered since it was sent
    always all m: Message, u: User |  receive[u,m] implies (m in Undelivered since send[m.from,u,m.content])
}

	// After a send the respective message can only stop being undelivered after being received
    //always all m: Message |
